# Resources for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Game Development

A few of you asked me about AI/ML and game development in class last week.  I will keep a running list of free online resources that I will update as I find more.  Just one word of advice.  When learning something like game development or AI/ML on your own, try to find small projects or small topics to understand first.  Like in game dev, maybe look at how you can build 1 room of a level first and how you can make a character interact with the objects or in AI/ML, learn how to classify handwritten digits (ex. train the model to recognize that a handwritten 2 is a 2) as this is a very well explored topic so there will be a lot of tutorials and online resources out there. 

## Mathematics for AI/ML:

While it is not 100% necessary to be an expert in calculus (single and multivariable), probability/statistics, and linear algebra, it is highly advantageous to have at least familiarity of those math topics for artificial intelligence and machine learning.  So here is a list of online resources.

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - I actually used this site for calculus, probability, and statistics review.  Requires registration but it is free and keeps track of your progress.
- [Gilbert Strang's Lectures on Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D&index=1) - Here is a YouTube playlist of an entire course of linear algebra at MIT by legendary professor Gilbert Strang.
- [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) - Josh Starmer is a professional data scientist/statistician who has an excellent channel on the statistics and mathematics of AI and machine learning models.  It is very approachable as it is not drilling a ton of theory/proofs of the math/statistics.

## AI/ML:

When we talk about AI and machine learning, the hottest field is Deep Learning.  In Deep Learning, we utilize a model (remember from Lecture 1 what are models) called Neural Networks (inspired by biological neurons).  These Neural Networks are the models behind ChatGPT, Dall-E, Midjourney, deep fakes, image facial recognition (how Snapchat can put dog ears on your head), etc.  Here is a list of hands-on courses/tutorials.

- [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) - Another famous professor, this time at Stanford, who teaches a free online course (through Coursera) on Deep Learning models.  You need to register but you can choose the audit option for the course so you don't need to pay.  The Cousera course uses Jupyter Notebooks (we will use Google Colab in our class so you will gain familiarity with it as it is almost identical to Jupyter Notebooks).

## Game Development:

In game development, the game designers and software engineers do not start building games from scratch.  They utilize something called a game engine.  There are many game engines out there.  This list I will update with tutorials later (I do not have a strong understanding of game development/game engines but I know some people who do).  Here is a list of resources.

## Game Engines:

- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) - This is viewed as the standard educational game engine as it is free to use and to sell your games using it (they do take a cut when you sell over a certain $ amount).  It is fully featured, meaning you can develop AAA quality games with it.  The main language it utilizes is C# (similar to Java, I haven't used C# but I have heard from friends it is much nicer than Java).  Many mobile games are developed using Unity Engine such as Call of Duty mobile.
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) - This is the big one that big studios use.  It is more difficult to learn but it is extremely powerful.  They have shifted to a payment scheme that is like Unity Engine's as forcing small development studios to pay for it made it a big barrier in the past.  The main language it uses is C++ (harder than Java).  In recent versions, they have added no code development (Blueprint) and Python scripting to aid in game development.
- [The Website Real Python's Article on Python Game Engines](https://realpython.com/top-python-game-engines/) - Since you all have familiarity with Python, you can also explore the Python ecosystem for game development.  The games that Python can make are definitely going to be simpler and less advanced (probably sprite based from Lecture 2) than ones built with Unity or Unreal Engine.  But they are a good way to dip your toes into game development.

## Language Resources:

- [Code Academy C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) - Again, you have to sign up but it's free if you don't care about some certificate.  Most online coding courses are about the same.
- [Cal Tech's CS11 Course: Section on compiling C++ code](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/mike/misc/compiling_c++.html) - After learning how to write in C++ I would suggest to learn how to make you code machine readable which means we need to compile the code to machine language.
