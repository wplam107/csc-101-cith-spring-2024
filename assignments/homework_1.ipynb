    "We do not write everything from scratch when we code/program.  We *import* code that is already written.  If someone else has already written code for handling dates and times and how to calculate differences and whatnot I will use their code instead of writing it myself since I am lazy.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are are assigning the value `10` to the variable `x`.  The `=` is called the assignment operator.  Most programming languages use `=` as the assignment operator.\n",

    "So you might be wondering how do we take 4 variables and combine them into 1 string?  Good question.  We can do this by creating f-strings.
